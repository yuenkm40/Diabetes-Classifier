## Description 
Our project aims to investigate the different factors that determine if someone has diabetes, in hopes of allowing the patient to receive treatment as soon as possible. 
We first start off with data collection from a given dataset which contains information about diabetic factors blood pressure, Tglucose concentration, bmi and many more. 
We then continued our project by doing some data pre-processing and data cleaning to deal with data outliers in order to ensure data integrity. 
Following which, we used exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to find out any possible correlations between the factors and the likelihood of having diabetes. 
We did so by doing a detailed univariate analysis for each factor. 
Subsequently, we trained our model and did feature selection on the factors to only use factors that were highly correlated to presence of diabetes in a person. 
Finally, we tested these factors by building a Logistic Regression model, K-Nearest Neighbors and a Random Forest Classifier for testing against the sample data provided.
